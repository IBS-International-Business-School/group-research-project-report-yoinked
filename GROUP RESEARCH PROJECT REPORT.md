## Introduction
This research investigates the viability of a food truck on campus at IBS University, Budapest. The campus is located in **Graphisoft Park**, an area surrounded by large companies but with limited dining options for students. There are only 2-3 nearby eateries, all relatively expensive. Additionally, the sole market close to campus lacks variety to provide complete meals, making it inconvenient for students seeking affordable and satisfying food choices.

Considering these factors, a food truck would be a valuable asset to the IBS community by offering an easy and reasonably priced alternative. This research aims to gather student opinions on food preferences, spending habits, and preferred purchasing methods to evaluate the potential success of a food truck and identify its most desirable offerings.

The study will analyze dietary restrictions and spending behavior to understand students' preferences for purchasing food from the truck, either in person or online, providing actionable insights for prospective food truck operators.

## Methodology
### Survey Design
In this academic work, an online questionnaire was designed and distributed to students at IBS University in Budapest to gather insights on general food preferences, spending habits related to food, and preferred purchasing methods for food served by a food truck. The objective was to assess the potential demand for a food truck on campus, given the currently limited and relatively expensive dining options.

#### Sampling Method
The respondents were randomly selected from IBS University’s bachelor’s and master’s students, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the student body. The survey was distributed via an online platform, allowing students to respond at their convenience. A total of 485 responses were collected, providing a sufficiently large sample to represent the broader population.

#### Survey Design
The survey included several sections focusing on key areas:

- **Dietary Preferences**: Questions covered food types like Halal, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other dietary needs, helping to understand the diverse preferences and their impact on food truck offerings.

- **Purchasing Methods**: Students were asked whether they preferred to buy food online or directly from the food truck, providing insights into the demand for online ordering, particularly among those with special dietary requirements.

- **Spending Behavior**: The survey included questions regarding students' typical spending habits. Participants were asked to categorize themselves as low, medium, or high spenders based on their typical expenditure on food. This was intended to help determine which price points would be most appropriate for the food truck offerings.

The online survey format allowed for efficient data collection, and the questions were designed to provide actionable insights that could directly inform the food truck’s offerings and operations.

#### Hypothesis Testing
Two primary hypotheses were tested through the survey data:

- **Spending Category vs. Dietary Preferences**: The first hypothesis aimed to determine whether students with different dietary preferences exhibited different spending behaviors. The null hypothesis (H0) suggested there would be no association between spending categories and dietary restrictions, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) posited there would be an association.

- **Dietary Preferences vs. Purchase Mode**: The second hypothesis explored whether dietary preferences influenced the method of purchase (online vs. in-person). The null hypothesis (H0) suggested no association, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) proposed that dietary restrictions would influence whether students preferred to buy food online or at the truck.

#### Data Collection Process
The survey was distributed via email and social media platforms, ensuring a broad reach among IBS University students. The data collection process was conducted over two weeks, ensuring adequate time for students to complete the survey. Once the responses were collected, the data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to determine significant patterns and correlations.

## Results
### Descriptive Statistics
The survey results revealed several important trends related to students' dietary preferences, spending behavior, and purchase methods.

- **Spending Categories**:
  - **Low spending** (Category 0): The majority of respondents in this category were students without dietary restrictions, with 95 students indicating that they typically spend less on food.
  - **Medium spending** (Category 1): The next largest group consisted of students with Halal dietary restrictions (35) and multiple dietary restrictions (30), indicating a more moderate level of spending.
  - **High spending** (Category 2): Only a small number of students fall into this category, with 6 students from Halal dietary preferences.

- **Dietary Preferences**:
  - No dietary restrictions was the largest group (95 students), followed by Halal (35 students), and multiple dietary restrictions (30 students). A smaller number of respondents followed vegetarian/vegan (13 students) or gluten-free (6 students) diets.

### Purchase Methods: Online vs. Truck Orders
The survey data showed clear patterns in how students preferred to make purchases:

- **Online Orders**:
  - A substantial portion of students with multiple dietary restrictions (27) and Halal preferences (30) indicated they preferred online orders, suggesting that students with specific dietary needs are more inclined to customize their orders in advance.
  - The majority of students with no dietary restrictions (95) preferred online ordering as well, aligning with the convenience factor.
  
- **Truck Orders**:
  - Students with multiple dietary restrictions (31) and Halal preferences (20) showed a slight preference for purchasing at the truck, though the numbers for this were lower than online orders.
  - No dietary restrictions students (102) overwhelmingly preferred purchasing directly at the truck, suggesting a preference for a more direct, in-the-moment food experience.

## Discussion
### Key Findings

- **Spending Categories**: The data indicates that students with no dietary restrictions are more likely to spend less on food, with the highest number of low spenders in this group (95). In contrast, students with Halal or multiple dietary restrictions show a mix of moderate spending habits, with 30 students in the medium spending category for both groups. This suggests that while students with dietary preferences may spend a bit more, most students are still cost-conscious, with a notable concentration in the lower spending categories.

- **Dietary Preferences**: The largest group of respondents had no dietary restrictions (95 students), followed by Halal (35) and multiple dietary restrictions (30). The diverse range of dietary preferences emphasizes the need for food trucks to offer various meal options to meet the needs of different student groups.

- **Purchase Method Preferences**: The preference for online ordering is clear across most dietary groups, particularly for students with Halal (30) and multiple dietary restrictions (27), suggesting that the ability to pre-order and customize meals is especially attractive to students with specific dietary needs. Additionally, students with no dietary restrictions (95) also showed a strong preference for online ordering, reinforcing the idea that online ordering provides added convenience for all types of customers.

### Implications for Food Truck Operators

- **Menu Design**: Food trucks should prioritize Halal and multiple dietary restriction options to cater to the significant number of students with these needs. Offering online ordering would also cater to the demand from students who prefer the ability to customize their meals in advance, particularly those with dietary restrictions.

- **Pricing Strategy**: The results suggest that most students fall within the low spending category, indicating a need for affordable menu options. Food trucks should balance pricing with quality and variety to ensure they appeal to a broad range of students.

- **Service Mode**: While online ordering seems to be favored across most dietary preferences, it’s also clear that students without dietary restrictions (102) prefer to buy directly at the truck. Thus, food trucks should offer both in-person and online purchasing options to cater to varying preferences.

### Limitations and Challenges

- **Sampling Bias**: As the survey was conducted with a relatively small sample of IBS University students, the results may not fully represent the entire student population. Expanding the survey sample could provide more robust data.
  
- **Response Bias**: Since the survey relied on self-reporting, there may be some bias in how students categorized their spending behavior and dietary preferences.
 

## Conclusion
This research suggests that a food truck on the IBS University campus could be a viable and successful business. The survey results highlight the demand for affordable food, with an emphasis on Halal options to cater to a significant portion of the student body. Offering online ordering would also cater to the convenience-driven preferences of students, particularly those with dietary restrictions.

Given the limited and expensive food options near the campus, the food truck could provide a much-needed solution, offering both convenience and affordability. The findings suggest that food truck operators should focus on diverse, affordable menu options and consider offering online ordering to meet student demands.


## Reflection
- **Prioritize Halal and Vegetarian/Vegan Options**: To serve the largest number of students with dietary restrictions.
- **Offer Online Ordering**: To cater to the convenience needs of students and those with dietary restrictions.
- **Keep Prices Affordable**: Focus on providing affordable options for students, as most fall into the low spending category.
