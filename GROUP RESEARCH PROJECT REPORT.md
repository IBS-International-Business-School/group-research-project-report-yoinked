## Introduction

IBS University is located in Graphisoft Park, which hosts multinational companies like Microsoft, SAP, and Canon, with over 5,000 employees. IBS has over 300 students pursuing degrees at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels. 

The aim of our research project is to explore and see the potential of a food truck offering diversified meal options on the campus. The underlying reasons why we chose a research topic on a food truck on the campus:

- **Limited eating options**: There are limited options for students and professors to eat both on campus and nearby places. There are a few places to eat like Planteen Café, Cube Café, but these mostly offer meals at high prices which students cannot afford.
- **Lack of affordable alternatives**: Besides, as for the supermarket, there is only Auchan hypermarket nearby which mainly offers bakery products.
- **Need for convenience**: Students are in need of a decent meal at a reasonable price around the campus
In the light of all the facts above, we believe that a food truck will be needed, that offers different meal options at convenient prices.

In this research, we aim at:

- Collecting only **Students’ opinions** on dietary preferences which is a range of multiple dietaries like dairy-free, gluten-free, lactose-free, halal, vegan, multiple dietary restrictions with no dietary meal option.
- Gathering data about their **Spending habits** and **preferred purchase methods** to understand what meal options a food truck should offer to have a succesful operation.

### Research Hypotheses
The research will test two hypotheses. First of which is to investigate:
1.	If spending behavior changes based on dietary preferences.
Second is to explore:
2. If dietary restrictions affect the purchase method which is either online or in person ordering.

Our goal is to achieve actionable insights by analyzing online survey targeted to IBS students.



## Methodology
We will now dive deep into the methodology.

### Survey Design

We created an online survey on Google Forms. The survey included:

- **Question types**: Multiple choice, Likert scale, and yes/no questions.
- **Focus areas**:
  - Dietary preferences.
  - Spending budgets.
  - Ordering frequency.
  - Preferred purchase methods for food truck services.

We distributed to IBS University students and got over `360` responds to the survey. We asked questions about their specific dietary preferences, spending budget, frequency of ordering and preferred purchase methods if a food truck is happened to be open on the campus. In this way, we can assess if a food truck has much of a demand from IBS students where their meal options are very limited and/or relatively high priced.

### Sampling Method
When we look at the sampling method, 
- **Target Population**: The respondents of the survey, 360, were randomly selected from bachelor’s, master’s and PhD students at IBS with the help of an online survey.
- **Reason for Random Sampling**: This helps us better analyze the population’s opinions based on the random diverse sample.

### Key Survey Insights
Furthermore, considering the survey questions, we mainly aim to focus on learning dietary preferences, preferred purchase methods and spending budgets of the target sample.
1. **Dietary Preferences**: 
   - In terms of dietary preferences, we asked if they follow or opt for specific dietaries from among dairy-free, gluten-free, lactose-free, halal, vegan or even multiple dietary restrictions.
   - Purpose: So that a food truck may have the most preffered diet options on the menu.

Secondly, the survey asked about students’ preferred purchase method by offering two options which is either online or at the truck ordering.
2. **Preferred Purchase Methods**:
   - Options: Online ordering or in-person ordering.
   - Insights:
     - if in person ordering is way higher, then we could arrange more tables as they would be eating on truck.
     - If online ordering shows much higher number than in person ordering, then we might enhance the ease of use for online ordering.
This gives us better insights on measuring the customers’ behavior on purhcase method.

Last but not least, the participants were asked to categorize their spending budgets on food as low, medium or high.
3. **Spending Budgets**:
   - Categories:
     - Low: Refers to budgets under 3000 Ft
     - Medium: Refers to budgets between 3000 Ft and 4000 Ft.
     - High: Refers to budgets over 4000 Ft.
   - Purpose: Hereby, we intended to understand the optimal price threshold that the customers are willing to pay.


### Hypothesis Testing
When it comes to Hypothesis testing, two hypotheses testing was carried out. In the first hypothesis:

#### Hypothesis 1: It is intended to spot if students with a specific dietary have a tendency to change their spending behavior either spending more or less than usual.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: States that there is no relationship between dietary preferences and spending behavior.
On the other hand,
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Claims that there is a relationship between dietary preferences and spending behavior.

As for the second hypothesis;
#### Hypothesis 2: We tested if dietary restrictions have any impact on customers’ purchasing methods.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Represents that there is no relationship between dietary restrictions and purchasing methods.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The alternative hypothesis supposes that there is such a relationship between dietary restrictions and purchase methods.

By the virtue of these two hypotheses testing, we intend to detect the relevant patterns, thus, contributing to determine the strategic decisions on operations of the food truck.


## Results
### Descriptive Statistics
The survey results revealed several important trends related to students' dietary preferences, spending behavior, and purchase methods.

- **Spending Categories**:
  - **Low spending** (Category 0): The majority of respondents in this category were students without dietary restrictions, with 95 students indicating that they typically spend less on food.
  - **Medium spending** (Category 1): The next largest group consisted of students with Halal dietary restrictions (35) and multiple dietary restrictions (30), indicating a more moderate level of spending.
  - **High spending** (Category 2): Only a small number of students fall into this category, with 6 students from Halal dietary preferences.

- **Dietary Preferences**:
  - No dietary restrictions was the largest group (95 students), followed by Halal (35 students), and multiple dietary restrictions (30 students). A smaller number of respondents followed vegetarian/vegan (13 students) or gluten-free (6 students) diets.

### Purchase Methods: Online vs. Truck Orders
The survey data showed clear patterns in how students preferred to make purchases:

- **Online Orders**:
  - A substantial portion of students with multiple dietary restrictions (27) and Halal preferences (30) indicated they preferred online orders, suggesting that students with specific dietary needs are more inclined to customize their orders in advance.
  - The majority of students with no dietary restrictions (95) preferred online ordering as well, aligning with the convenience factor.
  
- **Truck Orders**:
  - Students with multiple dietary restrictions (31) and Halal preferences (20) showed a slight preference for purchasing at the truck, though the numbers for this were lower than online orders.
  - No dietary restrictions students (102) overwhelmingly preferred purchasing directly at the truck, suggesting a preference for a more direct, in-the-moment food experience.

## Discussion
### Key Findings

- **Spending Categories**: The data indicates that students with no dietary restrictions are more likely to spend less on food, with the highest number of low spenders in this group (95). In contrast, students with Halal or multiple dietary restrictions show a mix of moderate spending habits, with 30 students in the medium spending category for both groups. This suggests that while students with dietary preferences may spend a bit more, most students are still cost-conscious, with a notable concentration in the lower spending categories.

- **Dietary Preferences**: The largest group of respondents had no dietary restrictions (95 students), followed by Halal (35) and multiple dietary restrictions (30). The diverse range of dietary preferences emphasizes the need for food trucks to offer various meal options to meet the needs of different student groups.

- **Purchase Method Preferences**: The preference for online ordering is clear across most dietary groups, particularly for students with Halal (30) and multiple dietary restrictions (27), suggesting that the ability to pre-order and customize meals is especially attractive to students with specific dietary needs. Additionally, students with no dietary restrictions (95) also showed a strong preference for online ordering, reinforcing the idea that online ordering provides added convenience for all types of customers.

### Implications for Food Truck Operators

- **Menu Design**: Food trucks should prioritize Halal and multiple dietary restriction options to cater to the significant number of students with these needs. Offering online ordering would also cater to the demand from students who prefer the ability to customize their meals in advance, particularly those with dietary restrictions.

- **Pricing Strategy**: The results suggest that most students fall within the low spending category, indicating a need for affordable menu options. Food trucks should balance pricing with quality and variety to ensure they appeal to a broad range of students.

- **Service Mode**: While online ordering seems to be favored across most dietary preferences, it’s also clear that students without dietary restrictions (102) prefer to buy directly at the truck. Thus, food trucks should offer both in-person and online purchasing options to cater to varying preferences.

### Limitations and Challenges

- **Sampling Bias**: As the survey was conducted with a relatively small sample of IBS University students, the results may not fully represent the entire student population. Expanding the survey sample could provide more robust data.
  
- **Response Bias**: Since the survey relied on self-reporting, there may be some bias in how students categorized their spending behavior and dietary preferences.
 

## Conclusion
This research suggests that a food truck on the IBS University campus could be a viable and successful business. The survey results highlight the demand for affordable food, with an emphasis on Halal options to cater to a significant portion of the student body. Offering online ordering would also cater to the convenience-driven preferences of students, particularly those with dietary restrictions.

Given the limited and expensive food options near the campus, the food truck could provide a much-needed solution, offering both convenience and affordability. The findings suggest that food truck operators should focus on diverse, affordable menu options and consider offering online ordering to meet student demands.


## Reflection
- **Prioritize Halal and Vegetarian/Vegan Options**: To serve the largest number of students with dietary restrictions.
- **Offer Online Ordering**: To cater to the convenience needs of students and those with dietary restrictions.
- **Keep Prices Affordable**: Focus on providing affordable options for students, as most fall into the low spending category.
